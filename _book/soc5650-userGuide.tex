\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

This text is a companion document for \textbf{SOC 4650/5650 -
Introduction to Geographic Information Sciences}. It is designed to help
you be \emph{successful} in this course. The idea behind a course
\textbf{User's Guide} is to create a reference for many of the
intangible, subtle or disparate skills and ideas that contribute to
being a successful researcher. In creating a \textbf{User's Guide}, I
draw inspiration from the work of Donald Knuth.\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth}{Donald
  Knuth} is the developer of
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX}{TeX}, a computer typesetting
  system that is widely used today for scientific publishing in the form
  of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX}{LaTeX}. He also
  established the concept of
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming}{literatue
  programming}, which forms the basis of some of the practices we will
  follow with Stata this semester.} Knuth has discussed his experiences
in designing new software languages, nothing that the developer of a new
language

\begin{quote}
\ldots{}must not only be the implementer and the first large-scale user;
the designer should also write the first user manual\ldots{} If I had
not participated fully in all these activities, literally hundreds of
improvements would never have been made, because I would never have
thought of them or perceived why they were important\ldots{}
\end{quote}

While there is nothing particularly new about what I am writing here,
and I am certainly not developing a new language for computing, the goal
of the \textbf{User's Guide} remains similar to Knuth's experience. By
distilling some of key elements for making a successful transition to
being a \emph{professional developer} of knowledge rather than a
\emph{casual consumer}, I hope to both improve the course experience
itself and also create an environment that fosters a successful learning
experience for you.

If you read through the course objectives included in the syllabus, you
will note that creating maps is only one of them. As much as this is a
GIS course, it is a course in research methods. In particular, we are
concerned with \emph{high quality} research methods and the
\emph{process} of conducting research. We therefore focus on a
combination of mental habits and technical practices that make you a
successful researcher. Some of the skills and techniques that we will
discuss this semester are not taught as often in graduate programs.
Instead, they are often the products of ``learning the hard way''. These
``habits of mind and habits of method'' are broadly applicable across
methodologies and disciplines.

\chapter{Getting Started}\label{gettingStarted}

Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that I
recommend that you do to help set yourself up for success. Before you do
\emph{anything} else, you should read through the
\href{}{\textbf{Syllabus}} and the \href{}{\textbf{Reading List}}. Make
sure you have a good sense of what is \emph{required} for the course. If
you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!

\section{Prep Your Computer}\label{prep-your-computer}

Before you do anything else for this course, make sure you get your
computer ready for the work you are about to undertake:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I
  would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent
  release of its operating system that the computer can run.
\item
  We'll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should
  ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is
  up-to-date.
\item
  You'll also need to download files, so you'll need to make sure you
  have some free space on your hard drive. If you have less than 10GB of
  free space, you should de-clutter!
\item
  Make sure you know how to access your computer's file management
  system.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app.
  \item
    On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows Explorer.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This of course assumes that you own a computer. Owning a computer is not
required for this course. All students who are enrolled in SOC 4650 or
SOC 5650 will be given 24-hour swipe access (\emph{just what you always
wanted!}) to Morrissey Hall to facilitate access to lab computers.

\section{Create Accounts}\label{create-accounts}

There are two major web services that we will use this semester, and
you'll need to create accounts for both:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{GitHub} - you can sign-up at
  \href{https://github.com}{GitHub.com}. Once you've signed up, fill out
  your profile, set-up
  \href{https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/}{two-factor
  authentication}, and let Chris know (via
  \href{mailto:prenercg@slu.edu}{email}) what your user name is. Once he
  has it, he can add you to the
  \href{https://github.com/slu-soc5650}{SOC 4650/5650} organization.
\item
  \textbf{Slack} - you can ask Chris (via
  \href{mailto:prenercg@slu.edu}{email}) for an invitation to sign-up
  for our team. Once the sign-up process is complete, you can log-in by
  going to our team's \href{https://slu-soc5650.slack.com}{Slack site}.
  Fill out your profile, set-up
  \href{https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication}{two-factor
  authentication}, and change your timezone.
\end{itemize}

\section{Download and Install
Software}\label{download-and-install-software}

There are a number of software applications that we will use this
semester. Most of them are free, and I recommend downloading those free
ones right away. All of these applications are available for macOS and
Windows.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Atom} - Atom is a flexible, open-source text editor that is
  produced by GitHub. You can download it from Atom's
  \href{https://atom.io}{website}.
\item
  \textbf{GitHub Desktop} - GitHub makes a desktop client that you can
  use to easily interact with repositories that are stored on the site.
  You can download it from GitHub's
  \href{https://desktop.github.com}{website} after you sign-up for an
  account there. You'll need that account information to complete the
  desktop client's set-up process.
\item
  \textbf{Slack} - Slack has a number of applications for desktop and
  mobile operating systems. I recommend downloading Slack on your
  personal computer, and optionally installing it on your mobile device
  as well. You can download their desktop applications from their
  \href{https://slack.com/downloads}{website} and the mobile
  applications from your App Store.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{For Graduate Students
\emph{only}}{For Graduate Students only}}\label{for-graduate-students-only}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{For Graduate Students \emph{only}}

If your computer meets the
\href{http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/get-started/system-requirements/arcgis-desktop-system-requirements.htm}{operating
system requirements} for ArcGIS and you think you'd benefit from having
access to the software at home, let Chris know (via
\href{mailto:prenercg@slu.edu}{email}).

If you are in the Public and Social Policy Ph.D.~program and your
computer meets the
\href{http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/windows/hardware-requirements/}{hardware}
and
\href{http://www.stata.com/products/compatible-operating-systems/}{software}
requirements for Stata, you should consider
\href{https://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/gradplans/student-pricing/}{purchasing
it} for yourself. I recommend purchasing a perpetual license for
Stata/IC. This is the most cost-effective solution for typical students.

\section{Buy Course Materials}\label{buy-course-materials}

\subsection*{Books}\label{books}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Books}

There are three required books for this course:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Brewer, Cynthia. 2015. \emph{Designing Better Maps: A Guide for GIS
  Users}. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press. ISBN-13: 978-1589484405; List Price:
  \$59.99; ebook versions available.
\item
  Gorr, Wilpen L. and Kristen S. Kurland. 2013. \emph{GIS Tutorial 1:
  Basic Workbook}. 10.3.x edition. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press. ISBN-13:
  978-1589484566; List Price: \$79.99; ebook versions available.
\item
  Thomas, Christopher and Nancy Humenik-Sappington. 2009. \emph{GIS for
  Decision Support and Public Policy Making}. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
  ISBN-13: 978-1589482319; List Price: \$24.95.
\end{enumerate}

There is one additional book that is optional:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mitchell, Michael N. 2010. \emph{Data Management Using Stata: A
  Practical Handbook}. College Station, TX: Stata Press. ISBN-13:
  978-1597180764; List Price: \$48.00.
\end{itemize}

Buying Mitchell (2010) is \emph{highly} recommended for graduate
students who will continue using Stata in the future and those who are
concerned about the command-line interface. I recommend waiting for a
week or two before purchasing this.

\subsection*{External Media}\label{external-media}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{External Media}

You will need a USB external storage device (either an external hard
drive or a thumb-style drive) that has at least 20GB of storage
capacity. This will be used for storing spatial data for this course.

\section{Download Course Data}\label{download-course-data}

Mots of the course data is available for download via Dropbox in a
single \texttt{.zip} file. If you want, you can let Chris know (via
\href{mailto:prenercg@slu.edu}{email}) that you'd like to download these
data before the beginning of the semester. Once you download them,
extract the data from the \texttt{.zip} file and transfer them to your
external storage device.
