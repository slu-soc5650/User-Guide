Another norm is to write using a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) known as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markup languages allow users to specify exactly how they want their text to appear when it is parsed and processed by special software. This is different from, say, Microsoft Word, which is known as a "what you see is what you get" or **WYSIWYG** editor, which uses a graphical interface for constructing documents.
